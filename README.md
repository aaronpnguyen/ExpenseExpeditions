# Expense Expeditions

Modular expense tracker giving users the ability to track their expenses for specific events as well as an overview of their spendings, built with MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and Chart.js

# *NOTICE*

Because I am not the greatest front-end developer, there may be some quality of life issues that will be implemented in the near future.

## Purpose

Users who have used expense trackers previously, may have found it difficult to see what they were spending due to the lack of visualization, statistics, or even categories for type of expenses they had.
Expense Expeditions allows users to not only see their data clearly through a pie chart, they are also able to see in-depth statistics to see what percent of their expenses come from.
